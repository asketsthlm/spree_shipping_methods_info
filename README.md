SpreeShippingMethodsInfo
========================

The extension adds two additional fields to Spree Shipping Methods:  
- `delivery_time`: The regular delivery time associated with the shipping method.  
- `return_conditions`: The return conditions associated with the shipping method.   
They both are strings.  

The extension is compatible with the 3-0-stable branch.
